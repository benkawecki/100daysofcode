100daysofcode
=====

This is my attempt at the #100daysofcode challenge. I am currently
following [Talk Python's plan](https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course)

Coming into this I have had a decent amount of experience in python through small personal projects. I learned the basics of the language through [Think Python 2e](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) by Allen B. Downey, which was a great introductory book. I then expanded that knowledge through my professional job where I have used python in the data analysis in jupyter with pandas/numpy and in the scripted control of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) through the Dronekit API. After all this I would consider myself a beginner/intermediate.

## Goal:
Become a better coder through the use of modules and techniques that I would regularly not come into contact with. Expand the breath of my python knowledge, learn better coding techniques/best practices and become more pythonic in my coding.
